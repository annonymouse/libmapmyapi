libmapmyapi
===========

A MapMyAPI library in C++ because I need to remember how to write C++ and I
wanted to play with MapMyAPI.  You should absolutely *never* use this library,
and re-examine your life choices if you find yourself using this.  There are
plenty of high level languages out there you could be using -- which are you
here?

gtest integration
-----------------
I cribbed the gtest/cmake integration from
